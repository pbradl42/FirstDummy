# FirstDummy
First repo, just learning the system

test - the instructions here aren't very helpful. Through both lectures, needed to figure out how to checkout and edit on my own.

## commands I had to use that are not in the lecture

* git remoate add FirstDummy https://github.com/pbradl42/FirstDummy.git
* git push --set-upstream FirstDummy master

## Commands in R that I needed to add to the lecture

* setRepositories() (chose everything except the 'bio' ones) before 'install.packages("slidify")
